The plaintext is a zip file (p2_file.zip) containing a single svg file (LLVM_Logo.svg). 
The key is "[95wJL4PiE)7u^P-Q(%^-_254dh1F@@nnE128eRo".

Since we know plaintext is of a common standard file format, we took some common file formats such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, ZIP etc. from this Wikipedia link (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures). The full list is in raw_formats in 2.1.py. The program takes all the file formats and gets a key from it, then check if the key is printable and only prints out whole keys that are printables. In our case, the only output was "ZIP" with the key "[95w". Then, we run 2.2.py to further verify this. 

2.2.py finds the most possible key length (40 in our case), uses that key length and possible known key to analyse the frequency of the partial plain text. Then, using the most frequent character in plain text (0x20) and the most frequent character in each column (ie. 5 of 40) and gets the key column by column. However, there were 2 columns that was decrypted wrongly by just using frequency analysis and had to be fixed (more details in 2.2.py)

Since we are not sure whether the plain text follows the frequency of the English language, we have to modify the frequency analysis used in Part 1. The program finds the possible key length by testing key lengths from 9 to 100, then calculates the percentage of printable chars. The most frequent result is 40, 80 with 0.99 printable where the next result only has 0.60 printable. So, it is very likely that 40 is the key length. With a known key of 4 of out 40, we were able to decrypt 10% of the ciphertext and do frequency analysis on it. 10% is a good approximation of the whole file. Then, we just find the key one by one and make sure the key is printable.

Everything up to finding the key with 2 errors is automated, then looking at the decrypted file (test_p2.zip), there were some really obvious errors on column 34 and 39. Then, we just apply the second most frequent char to find a better key and check if it is valid. Then, the whole file is decrypted(p2_file.zip). This happens because each column of out 40 is relatively short compared to the whole file, therefore the most frequent might not map directly.
